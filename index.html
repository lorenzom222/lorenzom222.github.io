Hi Lorissa, welcome to this website. You're probably wondering how we got here.... well it all began long ago when I got up to take a shit in the middle of the night. When I went to sit on the cold icey toilet, i braced myself. I knew it was going to be awhile, so i quickly whipped out my celluar device. Scrolling on twitter at 2am seems be a mindless thing, but.. then i noticed something. I'll save u the tech jargin, but main point is I noticed a way to make a website without paying any money. So that where we are today. It's this ground breaking anyways, best of luck on your journeys.
